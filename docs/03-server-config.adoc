== Server Configuration

Dshackle server tries to load its configuration from `/etc/dshackle/dshackle.yaml`, if it can't find a file at that path
it tries to load file `dshackle.yaml` from current working directory. If none of them found server fails to run with an error.

[source,yaml]
.Example dshackle.yaml configuration:
----
version: v1
port: 2449
tls:
  enabled: true
  server:
    certificate: "server.crt"
    key: "server.p8.key"
  client:
    require: true
    ca: "ca.crt"
upstreams:
  config: "upstreams.yaml"
----

It configures following:

- server is listening on `0.0.0.0:2449`
- TLS is enabled
- server certificate is located at `server.crt` with the key for it at `server.p8.key`
- the server requires a client authentication by TLS client certificate signed by `ca.crt` certificate
- upstreams configuration is configured in the file `upstreams.yaml`
